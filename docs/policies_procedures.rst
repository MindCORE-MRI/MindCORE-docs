General Research Policies and Procedures
========================================

.. _scan-rates:

Scan and Equipment Rates
----------

Rates for MRI scans and use of the EEG equipment are updated each academic year. Please see the main MindCORE Neuroimaging Facility `website <https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/neuroimaging-facility/for-researchers/>`_ for current rates. Billing occurs for booked time through the `Calpendo system <https://upenn-mindcore.calpendo.com>`_. There is currently no charge to book/use the mock scanner, behavioral testing rooms, or conference room. Please reserve these resources through the Calpendo scheduler.


.. _general-safety:

General Safety Precautions
--------------------------

The MRI environment involves strong magnetic fields that can cause serious injury or death. Please understand and adhere to all safety procedures, including:

- Do **not** enter the scanner suite unless properly trained and certified by the Facility Director. The scanner suite includes the control room and equipment room outside the scanner.
- Never take a visitor or anyone who has not been screened into the scanner room.
- Do **not** bring any metal objects into the scanner room.
- Never leave a participant alone in any room of the scanner suite (including the control room).
- Faculty Principal Investigators are responsible for the safety and actions of their participants, students, and staff.

.. _scanner-suite-access:

Scanner Suite Access
--------------------

The scanner suite includes the control room and equipment room surrounding the scanner. Users are granted badge access after completing all levels of MRI training.

.. _mri-trained-users:

MRI Trained Users
-----------------

Anyone wishing to operate the scanner and have scanner suite access must complete all safety training and a certifying test after attending and participating in at least 10 scan sessions and demonstrating proficiency in scanning procedures.

See the :ref:`User Access and Training Guidelines <how-tos/getting_started>`_ for more information.

.. _scan-buddies:

Scan Buddies
------------

MRI studies must be conducted by a minimum of **two Level-1 or Level-2 users**. If an investigator needs to leave during scanning, additional personnel may be required so that two trained individuals are always present.

.. _mri-observers:

MRI Research Observers
----------------------

Observers are allowed in the MRI control room as long as they are accompanied by a Level-1 or Level-2 user at all times. No one should ever enter the scanner room without proper MRI screening.

.. _scanner-etiquette:

Scanner Etiquette
-----------------

Common sense and courtesy are essential. Be aware, prevent unsafe situations, and leave the scanner in good condition for the next user.

**Safety**

- The PI and designated users must ensure the scan room is safe.
- Never bring metal objects into the scan room. 
- Please review screening forms carefully prior to the scanning session. 
- If there is any question about exclusion criteria, simply do not scan. 
- Make sure all volunteers are free of all metal before entering the scan room. 
- Always provide hearing protection to volunteers. 
- Never leave a participant alone in any room of the scanner suite. Follow guidelines that are taught in safety materials.

**Courtesy**

- Do not remove any cables or equipment from the scanner suite that do not belong to you. 
- Return any equipment changes to their original state (i.e., projector screen adjustments).
- Do not leave random loose cables in the scan room, as they can cause artifacts and accidents.

**Cleanliness**

- Keep the control room clean (throw away garbage, ear plugs, etc).
- Pick up any loose cables or equipment (return to storage) when you are finished using them.
- Fold and put away linen, and cushions when finished using them.
- Keep the scrub shelves organized and neat.
- When you are finished with your experiment, the scan suite should look like you were never there.

**Do not go over your allotted time**

- The control room and scanner should be turned over to the next user group at the beginning of their session. This means you should leave time at the end of your slot to remove your participant and tidy the room for the next group.
- Even if you get started late, your session must end on time.

**Responsibilities**

- As well as what is mentioned above, responsibilities also include logging scan time, filling out and filing screening forms, and backing up your data.
- Please report any scanner issues or broken equipment using Slack.

.. _incidental-findings:

Incidental Findings
-------------------

The scanner is not intended for clinical use, and sequences are not designed for clinical evaluation. Consent documents clarify that scans are not assessed for medical abnormalities.

Occasionally, an investigator may notice a possible abnormality. If this occurs:

- Report it immediately to Brock Kirwan (``bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu``).
- **Do not** inform the volunteer until the finding has been reviewed, to avoid undue anxiety.
- If warranted, Dr. Kirwan will forward the scans to be viewed by a radiologist and will communicate the results back to you, which either he or you can discuss with your research volunteer.

.. _subject-confidentiality:

Subject Confidentiality
-----------------------

The scanner and sequences are not clinical tools. Consent documents clarify that the scan is not evaluated for clinical abnormalities.

.. _irb-approval:

IRB Approval
------------

You may scan subjects for research only with proper IRB approval. Individuals operating the scanner must be listed on the study’s IRB approval. Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that:

- All safety and procedural guidelines are followed.
- Annual IRB renewals are completed on time.

You may **not** scan if the IRB has expired.

.. _scheduling:

Scheduling
----------

The Facility uses Calpendo for scheduling and logging MRI resources:  `https://upenn-mindcore.calpendo.com <https://upenn-mindcore.calpendo.com>`_

To request a Calpendo account, see :ref:`this how-to <how-tos/calpendo_signup>`_. 

MRI scans must be cancelled **at least 24 hours in advance** to avoid charges. Scans cancelled within 24 hours will be charges a $100 cancellation fee.

.. _accessing-data:

Accessing Your Data
-------------------

MRI data are automatically transferred to the Mac workstation in the console room. It is the responsibility of the research group to **back up their data**.

Training on data retrieval is provided during Level 2 training.

All image data must be handled according to HIPAA requirements. Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that data is handled appropriately. Failure to comply may result in revocation of scan privileges.

.. _devices-in-scanner-room:

Devices Brought into the Scanner Room
-------------------------------------

The Facility Director is responsible for installing all devices in the scanner room.

No device may be brought into the scanner room without direct approval and assistance. All equipment must be reviewed for:

1. Safety in the MRI environment  
2. Effects on image quality  
3. Ability to be safely removed and stored  

Electrical equipment must be properly shielded and kept far from the magnetic field. Even “shielded” devices may be magnetic.

Report any problems with stimulus equipment to the Facility Director immediately.
