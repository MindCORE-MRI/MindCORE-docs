Participant Screening
===================================

.. Note::
	All participants undergoing MRI must be screened prior to entering the MRI scanner room. Our recommendation is to pre-screen all potential participants for MRI compatibility prior to enrolling them in your study. Even if participants have been pre-screened, they must also complete the in-person screening using the hard copy forms found in the MRI control room.

Participant screening is an essential safety procedure and must be completed for anyone entering the MRI scanner room. Research staff will have completed safety screening as part of their Level 1 training. Research participants must be screened in person the day of the scan prior to being scanned using the hard copy forms found in the MRI control room. Completed forms should be filed in the appropriate folder in the control room.

It's a good idea to pre-screen your participants prior to scheduling them to participate in your study. We provide an online screening form (in English `here <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1AjDR1HL1iFW1G6>`_ and Spanish `here <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eY95nQ5GB51FD1Q>`_) that you can share with potential participants. 

If you have any questions regarding participant MRI safety, please reach out to Dr. Kirwan. While some implants and conditions are not compatible with MRI others may be MR-conditional or MR-compatible. For more information on what implants may or may not be allowed, please see `mrisafety.com <https://mrisafety.com>`_.
