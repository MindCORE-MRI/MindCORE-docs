Project Requests
==========================

Research studies are organized into *projects* for the purpose of tracking usage, billing, and personnel involved in the study. A project must recieve approval prior to the beginning of a study and before resources can be booked on the Calpendo scheduler. Researchers wishing to begin a new project may fill out `this form <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3z6wAfLUpMGQtjo>`_ or contact Dr. Kirwan directly for project approval.

Information required for project approval:

* PI Name (Last name, First name)
* PI Email Address
* Full Study Title
* Abbreviated Working Study Title (max 20 characters)
* IRB Protocol Detail page (or other narrative project description)
* UPenn IRB Approval Number (if available)
* Informed Consent Document (if available)
* Preregistration link (if available)
* If PI is a Penn affiliate:
   * Penn account number (26 digit account number)
   * Grant number (if known)
   * Business office manager or grants manager name
   * Business office manager or grants manager email address
* If PI is *not* a Penn affiliate:
   * Name of financial person to send the bill
   * Financial person email
   * Financial person mailing address
   * Purchase order number (if available)
   * Accounts payable information (e.g., point of contact, email)

In some cases, MRI studies may require an investigational device exemption (IDE) determination. The next two questions will help you determine if an IDE is required. If so, we will follow up with you and the Office of Clinical Research.

* Will the MRI results be provided as a report and/or affect clinical care?
* Will you be using a new coil (other than one provided by Siemens)?

It will also be helpful to know whether new projects require assistance in setting up new scan protocols and what equipment and room resources will be needed.
