Workday Training Certificates
===================================

Overview
----------
We use Workday Learning for several safety training applications, such as Level 1 and Level 2 safety training. Level 1 training must be renewed anually. Once your training is complete, you should send us your certificate of completion using `this web form <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6XMHWAViWQ4jXMO>`_  

Once a training is complete in Workday Learning it may take up to 24hours to access a completion certificate. To print a certificate in Workday Learning, use this procedure.
