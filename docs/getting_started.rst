Getting Started
===================================

This page describes the requirements and procedures for obtaining permission to access and/or operate the MindCORE Neuroimaging facilities at Pennovation Works.

. note::
	This process has some common elements with that of CAMRIS. For example, the online training for both Level 1 and Level 2 are the same for both MindCORE and CAMRIS. However, Level 1 and Level 2 designation is not transferrable between our system and CAMRIS (though if you have completed either Level 1 or 2 training through CAMRIS the MindCORE process will be pretty simple). In other words those who have obtained Level 1 clearance from CAMRIS will still need to complete the steps for Level 1 clearance at MindCORE. Those who have completed Level 2 training at CAMRIS may be fast-tracked in the training process for MindCORE (see below).

User Access and Training
------------------------

**This page describes the requirements and procedures for obtaining permission to access and/or operate the MindCORE MRI scanner facilities at Pennovation Works.**

Note that this process has some common elements with that of `CAMRIS <https://www.med.upenn.edu/camris/training.html/>`_, but they are separate processes. Those who have obtained Level 1 clearance from CAMRIS will still need to complete the steps for Level 1 clearance at MindCORE. Those who have completed Level 2 training at CAMRIS may be fast-tracked in the training process for MindCORE (see below).

**There are three levels of user authorization:**

- :ref:`level1` – Access Only
  Intended for all support personnel who assist in MRI protocols. **Required** for ID Card access to the MRI facilities.

- :ref:`level2` – Basic Operator
  For scanning human subjects under an IRB approved protocol. Allows scanning **without** an MR Technologist.

- :ref:`level3` – Advanced Operator/Trainer  
  For advanced, experimental use of the scanners, including sequence or coil approval.

.. _level1:

Level 1 – Access Only
---------------------

Personnel with a valid PennCard can access the Pennovation complex, but a separate badge is required to access the MindCORE Neuroimaging suite. Level 1 authorization permits access to suite 140. All support personnel who wish to enter the scanner console or magnet area should complete this training. Undergraduate students are eligible.

A Pennovation badge granting access outside the MRI Console room will be ordered upon completion of:

1. Submit the online Level 1 Registration form  
   (`qualtrics form <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6XMHWAViWQ4jXMO>`_)

2. Complete the following modules on `WorkDay <https://www.workday.upenn.edu/>`_:

   a. `MRI Safety Training Level 1 <https://www.myworkday.com/upenn/email-universal/inst/17816$1446/rel-task/2998$29489.htmld>`_  
   b. `HIPAA Protecting Patient Privacy <https://www.myworkday.com/upenn/email-universal/inst/17816$279/rel-task/2998$29489.htmld>`_  
   c. `CITI Protection of Human Subjects <https://www.myworkday.com/upenn/email-universal/inst/17816$532/rel-task/2998$29489.htmld>`_

3. Fill out the MRI Screening Form (`qualtrics form <https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1AjDR1HL1iFW1G6>`_)  

4. Receive Emergency Procedures Training (~30 minutes at Pennovation)

After your registration form is received, you will be notified by email when the next Emergency Procedures session is scheduled. Questions and forms can be emailed to Brock Kirwan at ``bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu``.

.. _level2:

Level 2 – Basic Operator
------------------------

Level 2 authorization permits access to the MRI Console Room and allows the user to operate the scanner using established protocols.

Restrictions:

- Scanning is limited to approved protocols, coils, and sequences.
- Testing unapproved sequences/coils is **not** allowed.
- Human subject scanning requires an IRB protocol allowing Level 2 operators.
- Level 2 operators may **not** scan human subjects alone.

Steps required for Level 2 certification:

1. Obtain Level 1 certification (see above).
2. Complete the Level 2 online safety module on `WorkDay <https://www.workday.upenn.edu/>`_: 
	a. `MRI Safety Training - Level 2 <https://www.myworkday.com/upenn/learning/course/421c7bb4670b1000b79d139a25880000>`_ 
3. Demonstrate competency in operating the Siemens MRI system. Competency may be gained by:

   - Shadowing Level 2 users for ≥10 hours, or  
   - Prior experience on Siemens systems (e.g., CAMRIS)

Competency will be assessed on skills including:

- Placing a head coil and subject
- Operating the scanner table
- Registering a subject
- Running protocols (start, stop, restart, reorder)
- Manual FOV positioning
- Copying FOV settings
- Inspecting images for quality
- Troubleshooting errors (including reboot)
- Reporting errors

When prepared, candidates should contact Brock Kirwan (``bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu``) to schedule a 1-hour on-magnet exam. Bring a volunteer subject.

After Level 2 approval:

- If you don't already have a an account on the `Calpendo scheduler <https://upenn-mindcore.calpendo.com/>`_, :ref:`request one <how_tos/calpendo_signup>`. If you do have one, request that it be upgraded to reflect your Level 2 status. 
- Your information will be submitted for badge access to the MRI control room. If you do not have a Pennovation badge, one will be ordered.

.. _level3:

Level 3 – Advanced Operator
---------------------------

Level 3 authorization permits operation of the scanner under testing and experimental conditions, including experimental sequences and coils. Only Level 3 personnel may operate the scanner after hours without another person
present.

Restrictions:

- User must have MRI physics expertise.
- User must be employed by or appointed at UPenn or HUP.
- Undergraduates are **not** eligible.

Level 3 access is generally reserved for MRI physics research personnel. Training and certification of Level 3 personnel is the responsibility of their research groups.

Contact Dr. Kirwan (``bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu``) to arrange Level 3 credentials.
