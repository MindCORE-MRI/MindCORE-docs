Getting Started
===================================

This page describes the requirements and procedures for obtaining permission to access and/or operate the MindCORE Neuroimaging facilities at Pennovation Works.

Note that this process has some common elements with that of CAMRIS. For example, the online training for both Level 1 and Level 2 are the same for both MindCORE and CAMRIS. However, Level 1 and Level 2 designation is not transferrable between our system and CAMRIS (though if you have completed either Level 1 or 2 training through CAMRIS the MindCORE process will be pretty simple). In other words those who have obtained Level 1 clearance from CAMRIS will still need to complete the steps for Level 1 clearance at MindCORE. Those who have completed Level 2 training at CAMRIS may be fast-tracked in the training process for MindCORE (see below).

There are three levels of user authorization:

Level 1 – Access Only
Intended for all support personnel who assist in MRI protocols. REQUIRED for ID Card access to the MRI facilities.

Personnel with a valid PennCard can access the Pennovation complex, but a separate badge is required to access the MindCORE Neuroimaging Suite. Level 1 authorization permits access to the MindCORE Neuroimaging Suite (suite 140). All support personnel who wish to enter the scanner console or magnet area should complete this training. Undergraduate students are eligible to become Level 1 certified.

A Pennovation badge granting access to MindCORE Neuroimaging Suite spaces outside the MRI Console room will be ordered upon completion of the following requirements:

Submit the online Level 1 Registration form [qualtrics form]
Complete the following modules on WorkDay
MRI Safety Training Level 1
HIPAA Protecting Patient Privacy
CITI Protection of Human Subjects
Fill out the MRI Screening Form (email or bring this with you to in-person training) [pdf download]
Receive Emergency Procedures Training (takes ~30 minutes at Pennovation)
After your Registration Form is received, you will be notified by email when the next Emergency Procedures session is scheduled. Questions and Forms can be emailed to Brock Kirwan bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu.

Level 2 – Basic Operator
For scanning human subjects under an IRB approved protocol. Allows for scanning without an MR Technologist.
Level 2 authorization permits access to the MRI Console Room and permits the user to operate the scanner using established scanning protocols.

The following restrictions apply:

Scanning is reserved to approved protocols, coils and sequences.
Testing of unapproved, experimental sequences and coils is not allowed.
If scanning human subjects, the protocol must be IRB approved for Level 2 operators (i.e., the IRB approval specifically does not require an MR Technologist).
Level 2 operators may not scan human subjects alone (i.e., they must be accompanied by a Level 1, 2, or 3 user).
The following steps are required for Level 2 certification:

Obtain Level 1 certification as detailed above.
Study the Level 2 Safety Document
Demonstrate competency with the operation of the Siemens MRI scanning environment and knowledge of the Level 2 Safety procedures. Competency may be gained by a) shadowing other Level 2 users for a minimum of 10 hours, or b) on other Siemens systems (e.g., on CAMRIS scanners). Competency will be assessed on skills including the following:
Placing a head coil & subject in the scanner
Operating the scanner table
Registering a subject
Running a scanner protocol, including stopping, restarting, and changing the order of scan sequences
Manually positioning the FOV of a scan
Copying the FOV from one scan to another
Inspecting images for artifacts, motion, etc, …
Troubleshooting scanner errors, including rebooting procedure
Reporting errors
When ready, candidates for Level 2 authorization should contact Brock Kirwan (bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu) who will schedule a 1-hour on-magnet examination. Note that you will be asked to bring a volunteer subject who will be scanned by the candidate.

Following Level 2 training:

Request an account on the Calpendo scheduler if you don’t already have one.
Your information will be submitted for Pennovation badge access to the MRI control room. If you do not already have a Pennovation badge, one will be ordered for you, which you will pick up from the main desk in the Pennovtion Center building once you’re approved.

Level 3 – Advanced Operator/Trainer
For advanced, experimental use of the scanners, including sequence or coil approval.
Level 3 authorization permits the user to operate the scanner under testing and experimental conditions.
This includes testing of experimental sequences and coils.
Only Level 3 personnel may operate the scanner after hours without another person present at the console.
The following restrictions apply:

The user must have expertise in MRI physics, with intimate understanding of the operation and risks associated with the scanner.
Only individuals who are either employed by the University of Pennsylvania, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, or who have a University or Hospital appointment are eligible for Level 3 authorization.
Undergraduates are not eligible to become Level 3 certified.
Level 3 access is generally reserved for students, trainees, faculty and staff whose primary research is in MRI physics.
Training and certification of Level 3 personnel is the responsibility of the research groups with which those personnel are associated. 

Contact Dr. Kirwan (bkirwan@sas.upenn.edu) to arrange Level 3 credentials.
